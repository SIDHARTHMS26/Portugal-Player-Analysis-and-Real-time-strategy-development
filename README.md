This project concentrates on an in-depth analysis of Portugal National Team players using 
FIFA 24 and FIFA 23 datasets. The research focuses on extracting key player attributes, 
measuring performance matrices, providing insights into developing team strategy, and 
suggesting a better selection of players. By performing exploratory data analysis, 
visualisation techniques and statistical methods we dive into several important aspects of 
player performance which include qualities like ball control, acceleration, pass accuracy, free 
kick accuracy, and special abilities based on their position. This work highlights essential 
findings such as player strength, suitable lineups for the team to perform well and the areas 
where improvements can be made to take advantage of the match. This research navigates 
through Machine Learning models to predict statistical-based strategies that can help the 
team officials make better decisions and have an advantage over the opposition team. We 
use models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and 
Convolution Neural Network to predict the strategy to utilize the players and their skills to 
have a favouring outcome. The project uses several methods to clean the dataset and 
normalize the values to implement them into the model architecture. The model has a 
realistic accuracy score of 60% as in these cases the events happening in real time are not 
predictable. However, the study indicates the chances of having a better outcome by 
considering the player selection strategy using statistical methods.
